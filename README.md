# Minuet [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/VARIANTE/minuet/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/VARIANTE/minuet/tree/master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/minuet.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/minuet)

Minuet is VARIANTE's on-going pet project for experimenting with web UI styling techniques. It is a stand-alone stylesheet library that supports vanilla CSS, Sass and Stylus. At its current state, it is not production ready, has an ever-changing API, and lacks proper documentation. Its features are driven by internal requirements and is meant for internal use only.

Minuet is packaged with many handy mixins and functions to accomodate efficient styling. It pairs well with [Requiem](https://github.com/VARIANTE/requiem).

# Usage
